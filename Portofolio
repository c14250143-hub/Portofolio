# ðŸ§  Day 1 Information: Data Analytic Essentials

Based on the Data Analytic Essentials class, I learned about the true nature of data from our lecturer, Mr. Resmana. Data is a term related to algorithmic letters or numerical values, which can be found in important documents such as financial reports, sales statistics, office matters, and many more. After explaining what data is, Mr. Resmana explained what data analytics is. From what I gathered from his explanation, data analytics is the analysis of business data using mathematics, statistics, and computer software.
